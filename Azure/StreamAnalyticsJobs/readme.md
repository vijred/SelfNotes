Stream Analytics 
================

`Stream Analytics jobs` is a full SAAS solution to stream data from multiple inputs and convert them to different destinations.

Example, I want to analyze the data from my Eventhub for a given scenario. I end up using Stream Analytics Jobs to capture all data live from Eventhubs and push into datalake for analysis.

I love its ability to use VSCode to run the same functionality where I can configure input, output, and jobs and run the same locally! Ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/visual-studio-code-local-run
