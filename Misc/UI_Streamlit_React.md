- **Purpose**: Building interactive user interfaces for websites.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Component-Based**: Break UI into reusable pieces.
  - **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering.
  - **Declarative**: Describe UI with simple code.
- **Usage**: Used by developers to create single-page applications.
- **Target Users**: Web developers familiar with JavaScript.
- **Security considaration**: Connections are established to the backend/API Layer from client sytem (Laptop). Required ports needs to be open from Laptop to access abckend/API layer.

## Streamlit
- **Type**: Python Library
- **Purpose**: Quick creation of data-driven web apps.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Simple API**: Easy to build apps with Python.
  - **Auto-Reload**: Updates app with code changes.
  - **Widgets**: Built-in components for user input.
- **Usage**: Used by data scientists to visualize data and build dashboards.
- **Target Users**: Python developers, data scientists.
- **Security considaration**: Connections are established to the backend/API Layer from app service where the Streamlit application s hosted. Required ports needs to be open only from app to abckend/API layer.
  
## Summary

- **React** is ideal for building complex web interfaces using JavaScript.
- **Streamlit** is perfect for quickly developing data-focused apps using Python.
